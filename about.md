I currently work at Predera as a data scientist, where I build data based solutions in domains like healthcare, retail, 
CRM and pharmacovigilance leveraging several machine learning and deep learning algorithms. I also build products which 
help data scientists increase their productivity by simplifying the process of training and deploying machine learning 
models at scale, and also monitor their performance during inference.
